# Support Desk Dashboard 🛠️

A frontend support ticket dashboard built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project simulates a real internal support tool with ticket management, filtering, and persistent state — without using frameworks.

## Features

- Create, view, and delete support tickets
- Search tickets by title or description
- Filter by ticket status (Open, Pending, Resolved)
- Sort tickets by date or priority
- Ticket detail panel with status updates
- Modal form with validation
- Persistent data using **localStorage**

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES Modules)
- DOM Manipulation
- localStorage
- Git & GitHub

## Architecture Notes

The application is structured using **separation of concerns**:

- `data.js` — seed/mock ticket data
- `storage.js` — persistence layer (localStorage)
- `ui.js` — DOM creation and formatting
- `app.js` — application state, events, and rendering logic

This structure allows the data layer to be easily replaced with a real backend API in the future.

## ▶Run Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in VS Code
3. Launch `index.html` using **Live Server**

## Live Demo

_(Add GitHub Pages link here once deployed)_

## Future Improvements

- Edit ticket functionality
- Authentication simulation
- API integration
- Improved accessibility and keyboard navigation
